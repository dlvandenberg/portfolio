At the _[Dutch IRS](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/)_ I was part of a multidisciplinair team that implemented an application to process loads of data regarding houses and its worth and owners. This data was structured in a very complex XML and had to be processed at all costs.

Next to processing the data, we had to extract personal information to identify and verify the personal data. I had a major role in designing and structuring the application. I also greatly simplified the XML data to a custom data model, so the application could work with the data independent from the XML structure.

### Responsibilities

- Analyse complex XSD/XML and design a more simplified data model
- Process messages from a MessageQueue and write it to a database
- Design a data model for the database in order to process the information properly

### Achievements

- Succeeded in mapping a very complex XML structure to a simple data model for further processing
- Analysed the information in the XML messages and how to process it into the database
- Wrote an Angular application for maintainers to see what messages were received and resend faulty messages

### Technologies/tools

Java EE, Java, JMS, JaxB, Angular, XML/XSD, IntelliJ, Git, Jenkins, Jira, Confluence, IBM WebSphere, MessageQueues, Mockito, AssertJ, Jasmine, Cucumber, Serenity, SAFe
