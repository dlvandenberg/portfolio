I did some research on web development at [Thales](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/) for a new application, which was the first application to be built in something other than Java Swing. For a tryout, I worked with a multinational team to develop that application in Angular. There were many obstacles in the process, but together with the team I managed to implement a Situational Awareness application using Angular. I worked with, and educated, a small team of Romanian colleagues.

After that, I moved to a different project within the company to work on an Angular application that visualised data of a fire control system. It was used by developers of that fire control system to support them during the development. I had the lead developer role to implement the Angular application. During that, I did some research and a proof-of-concept on microfrontends using Webpack's _Module Federation_.
