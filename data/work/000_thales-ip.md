The Interface Products department of [Thales](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en) was responsible for developing Resource Controls, applications to control different types of Radars and Sensors, which were connected to _TacticOS_, a tactical operating system used on navy ships. I designed the UI for a new radar tracker. By conversing with end-users, I learned how the system was used, in order to design the best workflows.

After the design period, I was part of a team to develop the UI and the backend for it. To test the working of the Resource Controls, we created simulators with state machines.

As multiple User Interfaces were created, I took responsibility of the consistency of these UI's, so they all looked the same.
