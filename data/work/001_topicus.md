At [Topicus](https://topicus.nl/sectoren/onderwijs) I was part of a team that developed a digital learning environment for students, teachers in high school. It consisted of several separate portals where students, parents of students and teachers could login and do their work, check their schedule our grades.

I was responsible for developing several new modules as addition to the already existing application, as well as doing maintenance and bugfixing on the complete application.

During the development, I made sure that new additions to the UI were consistent with the rest of the application.
