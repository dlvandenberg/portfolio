I worked for several companies as a consultant, during my employment at [Carthago ICT](https://carthago-ict.nl). These consultancy projects are listed separately in this section.

During my time at Carthago ICT, I set up a Slack environment for communication, I converted the website, which was written in SilverStripe, to WordPress and managed the content on it.

Inbetween consultancy projects, I worked on a React application with a Spring Boot backend. I was responsible for restructuring the datamodel and the Java backend and helped implementing functionality.
