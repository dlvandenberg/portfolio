Hi!

I am Dennis van den Berg, a professional Frontend Developer, a husband, father of two sons and a Powerlifter. Originally started out as a Java Developer, but I quickly started to move more towards Frontend Development.

When I'm not working, I like to work out three times a week to push myself and improve upon the major lifts in Powerlifting. Or, I like to experiment with new technologies.
