I wrote a tree-sitter parser for Angular in order to get better syntax highlighting in Neovim. There already was an existing parser for Angular, but it was not maintained anymore and it did not have support for Angular v17+ syntax, like the _Control Flow_ syntax.

This parser can be used in _Neovim_, using [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter). The parser is included by default.
