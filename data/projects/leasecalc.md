During my time as an IT Consultant, I had the privilege of being able to drive a company car. I could choose my own car to lease, but had a certain budget for it. Because I did not want to do any manual calculations, using the Dutch tax rules, to get my resulting paycheck, I wrote a small application to do it for me.

It is written in Angular and uses the calculation guidelines for taxes, provided by the IRS. You can compare your current paycheck with the resulting paycheck for a certain lease cost. The current paycheck data was stored in the browser's localStorage.
