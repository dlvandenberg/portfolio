With this Progressive Web Application, you can track your personal Powerlifting records. For the three main lifts, _Squat_, _Deadlift_ and _Bench Press_, you can enter your _1-Rep-Max_ (1RM) and see the progress in a chart. You can also track your weight and bodyfat percentage in a similar way.

I developed this application on my own, as a way to get more familiar with Angular and other tools and libraries. I used NgRx for state management and Firebase as a simple backend to store the data. All components are unit tested with Karma/Jasmine.

### Technologies/tools
