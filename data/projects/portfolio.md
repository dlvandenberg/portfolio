To get familiar with Svelte and SvelteKit, I created this portfolio website. I always wanted to create my personal portfolio, but never got around to making one.

When SvelteKit 1.0.0 was released, I felt that it was time to start experimenting and finally create my portfolio.

The data comes from a headless CMS, _[Strapi](https://strapi.io)_, and the _[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)_ consumes the data and generates HTML pages out of it. The UI is styled using SCSS.

In the near future, the site will be expanded with a blog section.
