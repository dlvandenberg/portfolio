After using Gruvbox and Catppuccin for a while, I was no longer satisfied with the colorscheme in Neovim. So, I decided to try and create one for myself, based on the colors of this portfolio. I really like the colors used on this site. Most of the other colorschemes that I found are too blue for me.

It is called _MountNugget_, from the words "Mountain" and "Nugget". My last name is Van den Berg, which translates to "From the mountain". And "Nugget" comes from GoldNugget. The colorscheme contains some _goldish_ highlight colors. The colorscheme does not fully support all integrations and you can only configure so much, because it is mostly intended for personal use.

Feel free to try it out!
