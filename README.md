## Overview

This application is built using SvelteKit. It contains my personal portfolio, as well as a blog section (coming soon).

## ðŸš¨ Open Source

This project is made open source, so you can see how I did things, for educational purposes. Please do not copy directly and claim it as your own. I spend a lot of time and effort into designing and implementing this portfolio. This is my first big personal project, and I am proud of it. **So, please, do not copy.**
